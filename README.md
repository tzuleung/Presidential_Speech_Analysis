# Presidential_Speech_Analysis

In this project, I:

• Web Scraped presidential speeches from www.presidency.ucsb.edu using R.
• Generated summary statistics such as total number of words and average word lengths from each speech.
• Detected keywords from the speeches with regular expressions and made time series plots showing pattern of word usage.
